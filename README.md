# Artificial Intelligence Domain Conversion Using Generative AI

## Overview

This project focuses on generating realistic face images from sketch images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The project leverages a U-Net-based generator and a discriminator network to convert input sketch images into high-quality, realistic face images. The solution can be applied in areas such as digital avatars, entertainment, and forensic art.

## Features

- Generates realistic face images from sketches.
- Uses a U-Net generator for image transformation.
- Employs adversarial training with a discriminator to enhance image realism.
- Built and trained on the CelebA dataset (15,000 celebrity face images).

## Technologies Used

- Python
- PyTorch / TensorFlow
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- U-Net Architecture
- OpenCV (for sketch preprocessing)
- CelebA dataset

- Model Architecture
Generator (U-Net): Converts input sketch images to realistic face images.
Discriminator: Trains the generator by distinguishing real images from generated ones.
